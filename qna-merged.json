    "question": "Dear Team, Thanks for your time ! I have been planning to buy my first car - Tiago XZA - shortly. However, fewcustomer reviews on YouTube and elsewhere inform that this car has drivability issue - i.e. erratic throttleresponse, sudden power surge, roll-back on inclines, etc. Does these issues really exist with Tiago XZA 2020model ? Your reply will be much appreciated. :-) Thanks, Umesh",
    "answer": "The Tiago\u2019s AMT let\u2019s you choose between three modes - City, Sport and Manual. Left to do its own thinking in the city, the AMT feels rather laidback. It is eager to shift up gears, no doubt in the interest of fuel efficiency. If you decide to drive at a pace, anything faster than leisurely, the two-pedal Tiago takes some getting used to. In this case you\u2019d be second-guessing as to when the gearbox might upshift.The Sports mode holds revs till about 3,000 rpm while cruising (about 1,000 revolutions higher than the City) and partially helps in traffic. But on the whole, it fails to make much of a difference. This Sports mode hits 6,000rpm when you floor the pedal, whereas the City mode cuts off at 5,000rpm. As it isn't equipped with the hill assist feature, so it may roll back if left out of turbo. The dharma of an automatic transmission is to make daily city commutes hassle-free. The Tiago's AMT fulfils its duty but in an unyielding manner and dictates the way it should be driven, forcing you to adapt to its calm and composed style. If you can do that, the smooth shifts make it a breeze to drive. But if you are in a hurry, a simple flick will put it in manual mode and turn the lazy Tiago AMT into a fun to drive hatchback. Moreover, we would suggest you to take a test drive in order to clear your all doubts.Check out <a class='lnk-c' href='https://www.cardekho.com/cardealers'>authorized dealership</a> details."

    "question": "Is Tata tigor is similar to ford aspire in build quality. like interior dashboard material, dashboard noise,seat material quality.",
    "answer": "If we talk about overall strength and exterior build quality, it would be difficult to compare as both are good enough but Ford Aspire hasn't been gone through a crash test yet. If we talk about the interior of Tigor, door panels get fabric inserts, though they could have done with some more padding, and the black colour feels dull too. The grey colour of the plastics also feels dull. There are more cubby holes to keep your phone, wallet or loose coins. The highlight of the interiors, though, is the backseat. If we talk about NVH, the cabin feels noisy though, as there is road noise, engine noise and wind noise seeping into the cabin. A quieter cabin would make the Tigor\u2019s rear seat an even better place to be in, besides reducing tiredness over long distances. NVH will increase with an increase in rpm. On the other hand, Ford Aspire design felt too simple, and interior quality was iffy in a few places. It did feel like Ford made it amply evident that you were buying a sedan on a budget. The cabin is oddly enough, remains pretty much the same as before. The Aspire does not get leatherette upholstery anymore. We'd say this is good, for two reasons. One, fabric upholstery is better suited to our weather conditions (and sweaty backs). Two, leatherette upholstery doesn't age particularly well. So, it is a blessing in disguise. There are still no cubby holes in the rear doors, the rear armrest still doesn't have cup holders, the front passenger seat continues to brush against the centre console when you push it all the way to the front and you still get that basic-looking instrument cluster (albeit with a bigger and better MID). If we talk about NVH, there are a few niggles though, the footwell feels a bit vibey, especially north of 80kmph. The rear feels a bit floaty at high speeds as well. The feeling is not intrusive or a deal breaker but it is present. There is a fair amount of tyre noise too that tends to creep into the cabin. This becomes especially prominent on rough tarmac, so state highways can be a noisy affair. In addition, you feel the vibe rather than hear them. Although, music does provide a good distraction. You may <a class='lnk-c' href='https://www.cardekho.com/compare/tata-tigor-and-ford-figo-aspire.htm'>compare</a> both the cars accordingly. Do take a test drive in order to get better clarity.

    "answer": "As per your requirements, you may either go for Datsun Go Plus or for Renault Triber. If we talk about Renault Triber, it packs in solid value, offering a lot of car for not much money. It could do with some more features, and a stronger engine for roadtrips but at least we now have an AMT for easier city commuting. It is practical and brings with it never seen before modularity in a fairly small footprint. Yes, it does leave you wanting for more on highways and on challenging roads, but the 1.0-litre petrol motor does the job adequately within city limits. So, if your idea of a family car is of one with plenty of boot space and a proper third row of seats, the Triber is a solid proposition. What makes it even harder to look past is its aggressive pricing, which makes it a good alternative for those looking for a versatile family car. On the other hand, Go Plus is light and nimble in the city, has peppy and efficient engine, its new safety features make it more compelling, great ride quality, 7-inch touchscreen is segment-leading. Nissan may be killing off the Datsun brand in other markets but it doesn't change the fact that the Datsun Go is a very practical, spacious and up to date city runabout. If you want a smooth driving experience with automatic transmission, you may opt for Go Plus CVT that offers a jerk-free drive.

Couple all this with one of the best ride-and-handling packages on any car in the sub-4 metre sedan segment, the Honda Amaze should feature on top of your list if you are looking to buy one in the near future. On the orther hand, the Tigor looks like a good overall package with decent equipment and frugal engines - though these are best used in the city. It isn\u2019t just great to look at, it also undercuts all its rivals in terms of price. But the lacklustre powerplants let it down.

The balance of the Alpha Apc platform too raises the bar on comfort and handling in the segment. And finally, the looks, which definitely set a new standard in the segment.

    "question": "Which is better between Celerio and Baleno?",
    "answer": "The Celerio won't intimidate new drivers and is a more stylish option than other hatchbacks. Also, it has more practical features, comfortable rear seats, and a peppy engine with impressive fuel efficiency. However, there could undoubtedly be improvements in the design, ride comfort, and cabin practicality, things that hold back the Celerio from being the ideal (city) family hatchback. On the other hand, the new Baleno is still a safe and sensible choice. Now with the design changes, feature additions, and improved ride, it has become more desirable too. Some things could have been better though. Maruti Suzuki should have improved the seating comfort, given it a more powerful petrol engine option, and made more significant changes to the exterior to help it look like a brand new car.

First launched in 2014, the hatch gets its first generation update after seven years. Powered by a new 67PS/89Nm 1-litre Dualjet petrol engine, with a segment-first automatic idle start-stop feature. It is available in four variants - LXI, VXI, ZXI, and ZX . The new Celerio is wider than its predecessor by 55mm and has a 40 percent bigger boot space, of 313 litres.

  },
  {
    "question": "How is the car for long drive?",
    "answer": "The Celerio gets a new 1.0-litre petrol engine with the Dual Jet tech with VVT and auto-idle start/stop to save fuel. Power and torque figures stand at 68PS and 89Nm, which are not all that impressive. But let's leave the brochure aside and focus on the drive. The first thing you notice as you set off is just how easy the Celerio is to drive. We mean a light clutch, gears slotting in easily, and compliant throttle response. All these combined makes getting off the line smooth and effortless. The engine has a good amount of usable power at the start, helping you accelerate at a brisk pace. It's not very quick but steadily builds speed. This nature of the engine also allows the Celerio to feel responsive within city limits. Going for overtakes is easy at city speeds and does not usually require a downshift. The engine refinement is good, especially for a three-cylinder mill. This remains true even when you push the engine to higher RPMs on the highways for overtakes. Cruising at 100kmph is effortless, and you are still left with power for overtaking. Sure, they need to be planned but are manageable. In fact, its 1-litre engine feels peppier than the 1.1- and 1.2-litre engines its competition employs. There's a bit of a learning curve involved if you're trying to drive the Celerio smoothly in bumper-to-bumper traffic. It feels slightly jerky even with minor throttle inputs, and Maruti should look to smoothen this out. While this engine has its merits, the 1.2-litre engine (in the Wagon R and Ignis) is still a superior unit both in refinement and power delivery. If you want a truly hassle-free experience, pick the AMT. The shifts are smooth and reasonably quick for an AMT. And because the engine offers good low-end torque, the transmission doesn't have to downshift often, allowing a relaxed drive experience. For a better understanding of compatibility and driving comfort, we would suggest you to take a test drive.

The Maruti Suzuki Ignis is a great little quirky car that packs in a lot and will put a big smile on your face every time you see it in your garage. A smile big enough to justify that price. When you factor in the class-leading features, the standard safety package, the Ignis proves to be a better value than what it appears at first. On the other hand, Hyundai Grand i10 Nios has leveled up on space, style, and features. The drive experience remains friendly as ever and with four options to choose from, there\u2019s a Nios for every use. And It is good for city commutes but out on the highway, it lacks outright power which stops it from being versatile.

    "question": "I wanted to differences between amt - cvt - and automatic transmission and which one is best from all sides. Then in hatchback which car is best in city use { from IGNIS , GRAND I10 , AMAZE .",
    "answer": "All three are transmission is good. Automated Manual Transmission is the automation of the conventional manual transmission system. There is no big change in terms of design, basic principles in AMT as compared to a manual transmission. AMT only eliminates the driver\u2019s effort for the operation of clutch and gear shifting selection as both are done automatically. As far as their fuel efficiency is concerned, things can be a little different from brand to brand. AMT options come quite close to their manual counterparts when it comes to fuel efficiency and if driven with a light foot, they could probably be even better. CVTs tend to offer a smooth driving experience as they are very linear in their nature and this is quite good for city driving. A CVT requires a smooth driver and this kind of transmission is not built keeping a sporty dynamic in mind. It is thus not the best option if you like picking gaps in traffic or making quick overtakes. The real magic of a CVT comes to light when you check out its fuel efficiency. Drive it with a light right foot, the way it\u2019s meant to be driven, and a CVT will end up offering you excellent fuel efficiency in the city. A torque converter is a good bet for you if your driving includes a mix of different scenarios such as slow city crawls in traffic, long highway stints where you easily cruise at triple-digit speeds or a twisty road that requires you to go through the gears often -- and all of that with the option of still returning a fuel efficiency that would be close to its manual counterpart. As per your requirement, we would suggest you with Maruti Suzuki Ignis because the Grand i10 has been discontinued and is not available for sale in the market, Honda Amaze is not a hatchback. The Ignis' quirks make it quite likeable. When you factor in the class-leading features, the standard safety package, the Ignis proves to be better valued than what it appears at first. Moreover, we would suggest you to take a test drive for a better understanding of performance and comfort.

For a car that stands tall, the Ignis has a well-cushioned ride. It rides on 15-inch wheels so it already gets an edge over other hatchbacks as far as ironing out minor road inconsistencies are concerned. The overall drive experience is enhanced by the well weighed steering wheel which is light at parking speeds but weighs up appropriately as the speeds rise. It doesn\u2019t offer much feedback, but the Ignis doesn\u2019t promise to be a driver\u2019s car either, so it can be spared. That said, thanks to the heaviness at the \u2018wheel, the Ignis would maintain straight lines on highways with minimal steering corrections. Maruti Suzuki has built the Ignis on its fifth-gen A-platform, which is stiffer than before and further improves its on-road stability. All in all, it performs great at highways and capable enough to munching miles. Do take a test drive in order to get better clarity.

    "question": "How is the performance of Ignis AMT in hills ?",
    "answer": "The gear changes are quite smooth by AMT standards. Upshifts/downshifts are noticeable, even at low speeds, but it\u2019s nothing unexpected. You can adapt to its behaviour quickly, even if you\u2019re new to automatic transmissions. The driver and powertrain chemistry will form quickly. Additionally, not only is it responsive when you want a quick downshift, it also revs up/blips the engine automatically before the gear change to reduce engine wear and smoother acceleration. Even the manual mode works very well, though, the gearbox really is intuitive enough already. So, it will do the job in hilly terrains but we would suggest you to keep tha car in manual mode while driving in hilly regions as this may not be a powertrain designed for a driving enthusiast.

    "question": "Maruti Dezire Petrol or Brezza Petrol or Nexon Petrol to buy under 11 lacs?",
    "answer": "All these cars are god enough and have their own forte. Maruti Dzire would be a great pick if you are looking for a comfortable car for your family and want good fuel efficiency too. The Dzire looks premium inside-out and has enough equipment to match its appeal. It has better driving dynamics as compared to other two. If we talk about Brezza, compared to its rivals, this SUVs cabin looks a bit dated and even the perceived quality is not up to the mark. At its price, the Brezza petrol isn\u2019t cheap either and the fact that it isn\u2019t as well equipped as its rivals marks it further down. But still, it remains a good value for money for an everyday city-centric SUV. The refined petrol engine should make it a better driver as well. On the other hand, among the best vehicles to roll out of a Tata factory ever, the Nexon comes very close to acing the compact-SUV game. The funky styling, big boot and some segment-firsts like an activity key make it a formidable force in the segment. Nexon offers better power as well as safety too. Also, now it comes with the option of sunroof too. Ultimately, choosing one boils down to your needs and wants.

    "question": "Baleno AMT is better or Altroz CVT technology?",
    "answer": "Automated Manual Transmission is the automation of the conventional manual transmission system. There is no big change in terms of design, basic principles in AMT as compared to a manual transmission. AMT only eliminates driver\u2019s effort for the operation of clutch and gear shifting-selection as both are done automatically. In AMT, clutch and gear shifter-selector mechanism are operated by a hydraulically operated kit which is controlled by Transmission Control Unit. Shift shocks felt in manual transmissions are not eliminated in AMT. AMT provides a limited gear ratio i.e. 4/5/6 speed similar to a manual transmission. Whereas Continuous Variable Transmission, it replaces the gears with two variable-diameter pulleys, each shaped like a pair of opposing cones, with a metal belt or chain running between them. In CVT engine is always operated at a favourable speed that gives best engine efficiency, whereas AMT engine is not continuously operated at a speed that gives out the best efficiency. Also in AMT, there is a drop in driving force during the gear shifting period that results in an unpleasant driving experience. For a CVT to be more fuel efficient than a manual, the driving must be very sedated and mostly constant speeds. For normal driving conditions, it may yield low fuel efficiency values. The CVT transmission is better because it has infinite gear ratio. Also, CVT is smoother than AMT."

    "question": "Which variant is value for money Sigma or Delta?",
    "answer": "Selecting the perfect variant would depend on the features required. Maruti is offering the Baleno with climate control, keyless entry and a rear defogger as standard. It also gets a decent safety package with ISOFIX child seat anchorage. The Baleno Sigma offers a lot of comforts as an entry-level variant, making it worth considering on a tight budget. On the other hand, this variant of the Baleno is fitted with features that would make it easier to live with, such as the powered outside rearview mirrors, a rear parcel shelf, and a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with steering mounted controls. The Baleno Delta is also the most affordable AMT option which gets ESP and hill hold as well. The factory-fitted features covered by warranty offer added peace of mind.

In Fronx\u2019s case, this holds true. Other than the front door and the mirrors that seem like a lift from the Baleno, it shares practically no other body panel with the hatch. Suzuki\u2019s 1.0-liter turbocharged Boosterjet engine makes a comeback with the Fronx. We\u2019ve experienced this motor in the erstwhile Baleno RS. This time around, it has the assistance of mild-hybrid tech to make it more frugal. The other option is Maruti Suzuki\u2019s tried-and-tested 1.2-litre engine that\u2019s available in a host of other vehicles as well.

The 5-speed manual will be the mainstay as before. On the other hand, The petrol-auto combo that we drove is an excellent city-dweller.

    "question": "Which is better in Maruti Suzuki Ertiga, Maruti Suzuki XL6 and Mahindra Marazzo?",
    "answer": "Both of Maruti\u2019s MPVs, the Ertiga and XL6, have been facelifted and updated. They now have a new engine, a new automatic transmission and a set of additional features. Since the design changes to the XL6 and Ertiga have been quite minimal, their proportions are mostly unchanged. The XL6 and Ertiga are now offered with Maruti\u2019s latest-gen 1.5-litre K15C petrol engine. It now gets a 6-speed torque converter automatic in place of the 4-speed automatic. The Maruti engine with mild-hybrid tech is more efficient, the Maruti Suzuki XL6 is strictly a six-seater and the Ertiga is a seven-seater only. The XL6 has become a far more premium MPV after its updates. Its feature-set now includes four airbags, ventilated front seats and connected car tech with remote vehicle controls. It also gets a segment-first feature in the form of a 360-degree camera. While the Ertiga is not as well-equipped as the other two MPVs here, it still covers all the basic comforts. It has a touchscreen infotainment system with connected car tech, rear parking camera, one-touch tumble in the second row, cruise control and Auto AC. The safety kit has been updated to include four airbags and an electronic stability program. Moreover, Mahindra has really stepped up its game with the Marazzo. It has managed all the basic requirements of a MUV spot on. There is ample space for adult occupants in all three rows and the quality of the materials and plastics will keep everyone comfortable as well. It does miss out on some creature comforts like the extra charging points and more airbags in the top-end variant but makes up for this in the sheer comfort that occupants will experience on long trips. The new 1.5-litre engine is efficient and powerful enough to haul a full load across the country as well. The only question then remains its long-term reliability and that\u2019s something that only time will tell."

    "question": "Comparison between Suzuki ciaz and Hyundai Verna and Honda city and Skoda Slavia",
    "answer": "Honda city's space, premiumness and strong dynamics are still impressive, but it\u2019s no longer the benchmark that it once was. The Hyundai, on the contrary, is an excellent choice if you plan to spend more time in the front seats and the rear seat experience isn\u2019t a priority. It\u2019s a cracking car for the price and loaded with features. The Skoda Slavia, on the other side, offers a sweet balance between the alternatives currently available in the segment, blending modern tech with great space, practicality and driveability. The Ciaz is the budget pick of the four then, but by no means, offers you a budget experience. If you want a hassle-free, comfortable sedan for four with the best-in-class engine, then it packs in all the essentials at a price that\u2019s hard to ignore.

    "question": "Do the new model head lights fit on the older model of Maruti Suzuki Ciaz?",
    "answer": "Yes, the new ciaz headlights can fit perfectly into the the older model ciaz. However the new headlights come at a price of around Rs 40,000 a pair if bought from the Maruti dealer (not all dealers are comfortable selling these as a spare. However depending on your relationship with a particular dealership/service advisor, they can sell this as a spare and you have to get this installed outside). I would advise that you look for similar headlights outside which would also be cheaper than the ones bought from a dealership."

    "question": "Maruti Suzuki Ciaz automatic how does it perform mainly on highways?",
    "answer": "Completed 20K on my Ciaz auto with regular highway runs. To sum up, the power is just about there. Nothing exceptional. The 4 speed auto works fine as long as your throttle input is calculated and gentle. A spirited slam on the accelerator will only confuse this box and the gear hunting becomes very apparent, all this while there is very little noticeable difference in the performance.This car is more of gentle cruiser. The ride is neither soft nor too stiff, it's in-between. Space is the biggest USP of this car and out on the highways, the light interiors and the vast glass area gives the car a very roomy feel. And then comes the fuel efficiency. Well this is where I believe Ciaz scores good well. On paper everything actually looks very doubtful. A 1.4 liter, petrol engine mated to a 4 speed Torque Converter auto box for such a big car!! Well in reality, things are very, very different. With a heavy foot (including sudden spurts of power for overtaking), 100% AC, 5 adults including luggage and at speeds of between 100 to 110 (Avg), I see a fuel consumption figure of around 16 KMPL (constant). In city (100% AC), I see the mileage dropping to 13 at the worst (this is still running without a oil change, will be going for it soon)!To sum up mate, this car can get the work done. You may miss the 'Wow' factor, but it's a pretty practical piece of machine for everyday use."

  {
    "question": "Which car is better, Kia Carens or Maruti Ertiga?",
    "answer": "Selecting between the Maruti Ertiga and Kia Carens would depend on certain factors such as your preference of the brand, usage, cabin space, fuel type, etc. The Ertiga seemingly does it all. But you will buy it more because you need it rather than want it. It doesn't have any glaring faults but it could also be a lot better. Maruti Ertiga is offered a single BS6-compliant petrol engine. The 1.5-litre motor produces 105PS of power and 138Nm of torque. It is paired with a 12-volt Smart Hybrid mild-hybrid system. On the other hand, If you cover the badge, it would be hard to connect the Carens to its siblings. Firstly, the Kia signature \u201ctiger nose\u201d grille, as we know it, is gone. Instead, the tiger-nose is transformed into a motif that is used on the piano black grille and the chrome finish on the bumper. The only obvious connection to any of Kia\u2019s SUVs is the DRLs; in specific the Sonet\u2019s, albeit with an extra wriggle thrown in at the outer edges. Other than this flourish, the Carens have carefully avoided drama. No deep creases or racy lines slice the bodywork here. So, unlike the Sonet, it doesn\u2019t look muscular. And unlike the Seltos, it doesn't look flashy either. Instead, it has been designed to be smart and attractive, but not bold. If you look at the Carens head-on, the narrow brow gives it an air of submissiveness. Moreover, we would suggest you take a test drive before making the final decision.

    "question": "Is Petrol 2.0 engine good enough for 7 adults in manual transmission ?",
    "answer": "You may go for the manual transmission and you would not face any issue with the driving. However, we would recommend the automatic as it could prove to be a great daily driver, offering progressive power delivery and excellent cruising ability.. It\u2019s also a very refined engine, and the experience in the cabin is very smooth. The overall driving behaviour is best suited to a relaxed driving style. The peak performance is higher up in the rev band, so if you go for quick overtakes or want to drive fast, the transmission will downshift. The engine will rev up quickly and get close to the redline, getting very loud in the process.

    "answer": "All three cars are good in their own forte. The Hyundai Kona Electric is a car and a landmark moment that paves the way for every electric car that follows. Kona is a feature loaded car and offers a Super smooth drive experience. On the other hand, the Nexon EV is a package that makes a lot of sense. To top it off, the Nexon EV is just as family-friendly as the petrol/diesel Nexon and presents itself as a very good all-rounder when it comes to daily usability.

As manufacturers gear up towards getting their BS6 products on the road, they will be offering significant discounts on their BS4 counterparts to clear stock. They would try to do so well before the April 2020 deadline to avoid any unsold BS4 stock. So we expect most manufacturers to stop selling BS4 vehicles by early 2020. You could go bargain hunting then as the few unsold stocks could attract huge discounts. The reason to go for a BS6 vehicle despite the increased costs would be the added features. Also, you would be polluting the environment less. a transition from BS4 to BS6 has in most cases resulted in a minor drop in power. According to the upcoming emission norms, BS6-compliant vehicles should be 25 percent cleaner than their BS4 counterparts. While BS4 vehicles are currently allowed a NOx (Nitrous Oxide) pollutant level of 80mg/km, BS6-compliant vehicles will have NOx levels reduced to 60 mg/km."

  },
  {
    "question": "Is this good for long drives? ",
    "answer": "The Bolero Neo has received its first mechanical update in the form of an engine retune. The 1.5-litre diesel engine now makes 100PS of power and 260Nm of torque. These figures are not just better than before, but 24PS and 50Nm more than the Bolero as well. And these numbers do translate into a more relaxed and effortless drive. There is lots of torque at low revs which helps the 1.5 tonne SUV pick up gracefully. And because this engine makes more power as well, the Bolero Neo builds speed with more ease than the Bolero. Cruising at triple digit speeds will be calmer as well and this has more grunt for high speed overtakes. The 5-speed transmission is easy to slot in and the clutch is light too, making for friendly city commutes. The suspension too has been reworked to offer you better stability at higher speeds. However, this has rubbed off on the ride in a negative manner. There is a firmness in the suspension which, at light load, will be felt in the cabin. Over speed breakers or bumps, the cabin does move around a bit, more so at the back. A quick fix to this is not to slow down. Go over these with momentum and the Neo just glides over them. Again, less so for the rear passengers. On the other side, the stiffer springs have given the Neo better handling characteristics. Combined with the lower centre of gravity, it does manage its weight better and feel more stable on high speed lane changes and corners. There is still a lot of body roll, just less than before. For a better understanding of compatibility and driving comfort, we would suggest you to take a test drive.

    "question": "Confused between desil and petrol as the waiting period of desil is 2 year and petrol can be deliver withinyear",
    "answer": "Selecting the right fuel type depends on your utility and the average running of the car. If you drive less than 50km in a day then we recommend you to go with a petrol car as they are easy to maintain, have a longer life span and they cost less initially than the diesel car. On the other hand, diesel cars are preferred if the average daily run is more than 50km which makes it a feasible purchase. Diesel cars are more fuel-efficient and provide more torque, therefore, are preferred for a person who drives more than 50km. Whereas, petrol engine has a low service cost, more life span, generally have a well-controlled NVH level and are cheaper in cost than the diesel engines.

What you can do is is fold the third row to open up a nice and large flat boot floor which will accommodate all of your large suitcases and bags for the entire family for the weekend trip. If you still want more space then you can fold even the second row flat, which will open up space for oversized items like a washing machine or table.

  {
    "question": "Is it comfortable for driving in XUV700?",
    "answer": "The highlight of the petrol engine, while you might think is the 200PS power figure, is actually the refinement. It doesn't let any vibration or harsh sound creep into the cabin and gives you a very calm driving experience. Another highlight is its smooth power delivery because of which you get a very linear and smooth acceleration and the 200PS power figure does not feel intimidating. However, start getting generous with the throttle and the city overtakes are dispatched with ease. Even on the highway, all you have to do is press a little harder on the accelerator pedal and the XUV completes high speed overtakes just as easily. But even under full-throttle conditions, the performance of the petrol engine does not feel peppy or exciting. While the 200 horses are certainly there, they are focused on making your drive effortless rather than thrilling. Also as of now, there are no drive modes on offer with the petrol engines, and another thing that you will have to be careful of is the fuel efficiency. This being a 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine, hauling a large SUV will certainly not be as frugal as the diesel. The automatic transmission is also focused on making your drive as effortless as possible. It keeps you in the right gear and the shifts are quick and smooth. It's only when you demand a quick downshift that it can feel a tad slow. The diesel engine is also the one you should pick if you are mostly going to be on the highway. It gets four drive modes: Zip, Zap, Zoom and Custom. The one aspect of the XUV that you will absolutely love is the comfort it offers to its occupants. This time around the XUV gets frequency selective damping like the Compass, which will keep it stable in corners and over smaller bumps while softening the damping to take on bigger speed breakers and potholes. This really shows while you are driving on our mixed road conditions. The XUV can glide over the imperfections on the road and you won't feel much of the bigger undulations as well. The rear suspension does feel a tad soft but that too settles down quickly and does not make the right feel bouncy. And all of this happens with the suspension being absolutely silent. For a better understanding of compatibility and driving comfort, we would suggest you to take a test drive.

    "question": "Is it ok to go for xuv 500 bs 4 model or wait for bs 6 model?",
    "answer": "If you are looking for vehicles with discounts, the end of this year would be the best time to buy a BS4-era car. As manufacturers gear up towards getting their BS6 products on the road, they will be offering significant discounts on their BS4 counterparts to clear stock. They would try to do so well before the April 2020 deadline to avoid any unsold BS4 stock. So we expect most manufacturers to stop selling BS4 cars by early 2020. You could go bargain hunting then as the few unsold stocks could attract huge discounts. The reason to go for a BS6 vehicle despite the increased costs would be the added features. Also, you would be polluting the environment less. a transition from BS4 to BS6 has in most cases resulted in a minor drop in power. According to the upcoming emission norms, BS6-compliant four-wheelers should be 25 percent cleaner than their BS4 counterparts. While BS4 vehicles are currently allowed a NOx (Nitrous Oxide) pollutant level of 80mg/km, BS6-compliant vehicles will have NOx levels reduced to 60 mg/km."

    "question": "Which is good to buy, Honda Amaze or Maruti Baleno?",
    "answer": "Both the cars are good in their forte. The Honda Amaze scores well in most departments: - a punchy diesel motor, sedan-like comfort, and a well-loaded practical cabin. The weak link has to be its petrol engine, which is extremely refined and just about acceptable for city commutes but not for spirited driving. The 2021 Amaze continues to get a dual-tone layout for its interior which makes the cabin feel airier, spacious, and fresh. The build quality and fit-finish of the interior are impressive as well, and everything including the center console and equipment such as the front AC vents and glovebox is well-integrated. On the other hand, the new Baleno is based on the same Heartect platform as the old car and as a result, in terms of size it hasn't changed much. Wheelbase and width are exactly the same and in terms of length and height, it is slightly smaller. But what has gone up is weight. As compared to the old car the new Baleno is up to 65kg heavier. According to Maruti, 20 percent of the weight gain is because of the new Dual Jet motor and the rest of it is down to the thicker body panels. Whether that has lent any improvement in terms of safety is something that we will know only after it goes through a crash test. the Baleno is a value-for-money family hatchback that\u2019s practical, well-equipped, efficient, and easy to drive. Moreover, we would suggest you to take a test drive before making the final decision.

    "answer": "The Astor is managing to stand out in the segment with its looks, tech and upmarket cabin experience. And the rest of the elements like drive and comfort are also looking promising. The only chink in its armour is looking to be the cabin width for three at the back, boot space and missing headline features. However, if MG can get the price right between Rs 10 lakh to Rs 18 lakh ex-showroom the Astor could well be among the favourites to pick in the segment. On the other hand, the Compass continues to excel at being itself. It remains a powerful yet easy SUV to drive that combines a cushioned ride experience with excellent corner stability to deliver an un-SUV like experience. Jeep\u2019s sweetened the pot with an all new interior which makes the experience more premium than before. It's also added many features that, to be honest, should have been there from before keeping the Compass\u2019 price in mind."

The NA engine is would be a ideal pick for a no-nonsense city commuter with its easy going nature. However, if its performance you are after then we would suggest you to go with the 1.3-litre turbocharged unit (140PS/220Nm) available with a 6-speed automatic.

  },
  {
    "question": "How is the engine? Is it under-powered?",
    "answer": "We got our hands on the 1.3-litre turbo-petrol which makes 140PS of power and 220Nm of torque. It only comes mated to a 6-speed torque converter automatic. The other engine option available is 1.5-litre petrol which makes 110PS of power and 144Nm of torque. It can be had with a 5-speed MT and an optional 8-speed CVT automatic. The Astor\u2019s power delivery is smooth. This, right from the pickup, gives you a nice and linear acceleration. Start going on the throttle and the Astor builds speed in a strong manner. And because this is a torque converter automatic, the turbo lag is taken care of and you don't struggle for power while cruising in the city. Start going heavier on the throttle and the same linear acceleration greets you. It\u2019s not very exciting but there is ample pull for overtakes. And even beyond, the Astor keeps on going. At BIC, we recorded a 0-100kmph time of 10.76 seconds, which is impressive. And the Astor kept pulling ahead as well, with a recorded top speed of 164.33kmph. So be it city commuting or highway touring, the Astor, at least in its turbo guise, will manage it without breaking a sweat. Even the transmission, though a bit slow to shift on a racetrack, should feel fine in the city. Here, drive modes could have helped the Astor have a better dual personality.

    "question": "Which is the best MG Hector or Kia Seltos?",
    "answer": "Both cars are good in their own forte, the Hector has always been a bold-looking SUV, thanks to the heavy chrome usage on its front fascia. The changes, though subtle, are a bit more \u2018in-your-face,\u2019 starting with the obviously bigger grille. It now features diamond-shaped chrome embellishments while the grille has a black surround instead of chrome, making it look a lot bolder. However, those who aren\u2019t a fan of extensive chrome on their cars would certainly feel it is too much here. A key strong point of the Hector has always been its cushiony drive quality. It still works well at keeping almost all effects from the undulations and uneven surfaces at bay from the occupants, especially on highway journeys. It\u2019s only over rough roads at slower speeds that you can experience some side-to-side movement and particularly sharp bumps inside the cabin. On the other hand, the Seltos continues to impress with added standard safety and claims better ride quality. It is a vehicle you can\u2019t go wrong with. Because of its high wow factor, it attracts a lot of attention. More importantly, it backs it up with a solid and sensible personality too. Moreover, we would suggest you to take a test drive before making the final decision.

    "question": "Which engine is best, 1.3 or 1.5?",
    "answer": "The first is 1.5-litre naturally aspirated (mated to a 5-speed manual and CVT automatic options), making 110PS. If you chase performance, you can go for the 1.3-litre turbo petrol (paired with a 6-speed torque converter) making 140PS. We drove the Astor mainly on the circuit, and after two hot laps around the Buddh\u2019s technical layout, we came away quite surprised. Obviously, it\u2019s not a sports car, but we weren't expecting it to be as much fun as it turned out to be. The turbo-petrol motor has good pulling power, and thanks to its free-revving nature, we managed to cross 160kmph down the long 1km straight with ease. The gearbox does feel a bit slow -- both in terms of upshifts and downshifts -- especially out on the racetrack. But on the road, it might prove to be quick enough. What this gearbox does well, however, is it masks this motor's initial lag, which is typical of most turbo-petrol engines. On the other hand, The 1.5-litre engine was the only choice and we managed to drive both the manual and auto variants. The engine is smooth and refined with linear power delivery and there's plenty of power for exciting twisty roads as well as effortless long trips. We had no trouble hitting triple-digit speeds with ease and Skoda's claims of 8.6 seconds to 100kmph sounds perfectly believable. Only going to drive in the city? Well, the motor pulls from as low as 1300rpm, so it has excellent driveability at city speeds as well.

It's comfortable over paved roads, absorbing small imperfections well, staying composed over bigger bumps, and settling quickly after. The suspension does a good job over completely broken roads as well and though there is some side-to-side motion, it isn't uncomfortable. This translates to good handling around corners as well. The Kushaq remains planted with very little body roll. The steering is comfortably weighted in the city and weighs up nicely on the highway as well.

In terms of looks, build and design, Skoda seems to have nailed the brief. When it comes to performance, there's little more you could ask for from the two tractable powertrains. It also gets a long list of features, including some premium items too. The Kushaq has all the basics covered with ventilated seats, climate control, auto headlamps, cruise control, sunroof, and wireless charger. There's even telescopic adjustment for the steering, rain-sensing wipers, and touch controls for the climate. However, the competition does a little better with features like powered seats, a digital instrument cluster, an air purifier, drive and traction modes, and a panoramic sunroof.

    "question": "I am looking for Skoda Superb. My priority is reliability, low maintenance and a decent mileage. Is it worth waiting for Fortuner or Kodiaq in 2021?",
    "answer": "The Superb is the last of a dying breed. All its competitors have suffered a painful death, being trampled upon by SUVs. The ones that managed to survive, like the Toyota Camry or the Honda Accord till some time ago, went hybrid. So the fact that the Superb still managed to come out the other end of the tunnel, using the formula of a luxurious, spacious and sporty limousine, which it first brought to India almost a decade ago is nothing short of an achievement itself. With this facelifted Superb, Skoda has once again reminded us of what we will miss once the SUVs and the electrics fully take over. A sedan that packs in luxury, comfort, space and sheer driving pleasure all in one. If only the Superb offered the very latest technology like the SUVs of today, maybe we would see a resurgence in its sales. It attracts a considerable service cost as per it premium. And after all this if you are still thinking about the Superb, our recommendation is, don\u2019t think twice. On the other hand, <a class='lnk-c' href='https://www.cardekho.com/overview/Toyota_Fortuner_2020/Toyota_Fortuner_2020.htm'>Fortuner</a> and <a class='lnk-c' href='https://www.cardekho.com/overview/Skoda_kodiaq_2020/Skoda_kodiaq_2020.htm'>Kodiaq</a> are of the different segment and have different characteristics too.

The main limitation it has is highway usage: It\u2019s very easy to drive at high speeds but will lose range quite quickly. Whereas The MG ZS EV isn\u2019t just an eco-friendly car it\u2019s also quite family-friendly. In addition to being easy to drive in a variety of conditions, it also offers some excitement with its punchy performance.

As manufacturers gear up towards getting their BS6 products on the road, they will be offering significant discounts on their BS4 counterparts to clear stock. They would try to do so well before the April 2020 deadline to avoid any unsold BS4 stock. So we expect most manufacturers to stop selling BS4 vehicles by early 2020. You could go bargain hunting then as the few unsold stocks could attract huge discounts. The reason to go for a BS6 vehicle despite the increased costs would be the added features. Also, you would be polluting the environment less. a transition from BS4 to BS6 has in most cases resulted in a minor drop in power. According to the upcoming emission norms, BS6-compliant vehicles should be 25 percent cleaner than their BS4 counterparts. While BS4 vehicles are currently allowed a NOx (Nitrous Oxide) pollutant level of 80mg/km, BS6-compliant vehicles will have NOx levels reduced to 60 mg/km."

    "question": "Is this good for long drives? ",
    "answer": "The Bolero Neo has received its first mechanical update in the form of an engine retune. The 1.5-litre diesel engine now makes 100PS of power and 260Nm of torque. These figures are not just better than before, but 24PS and 50Nm more than the Bolero as well. And these numbers do translate into a more relaxed and effortless drive. There is lots of torque at low revs which helps the 1.5 tonne SUV pick up gracefully. And because this engine makes more power as well, the Bolero Neo builds speed with more ease than the Bolero. Cruising at triple digit speeds will be calmer as well and this has more grunt for high speed overtakes. The 5-speed transmission is easy to slot in and the clutch is light too, making for friendly city commutes. The suspension too has been reworked to offer you better stability at higher speeds. However, this has rubbed off on the ride in a negative manner. There is a firmness in the suspension which, at light load, will be felt in the cabin. Over speed breakers or bumps, the cabin does move around a bit, more so at the back. A quick fix to this is not to slow down. Go over these with momentum and the Neo just glides over them. Again, less so for the rear passengers. On the other side, the stiffer springs have given the Neo better handling characteristics. Combined with the lower centre of gravity, it does manage its weight better and feel more stable on high speed lane changes and corners. There is still a lot of body roll, just less than before. For a better understanding of compatibility and driving comfort, we would suggest you to take a test drive.

The changes, though subtle, are a bit more \u2018in-your-face,\u2019 starting with the obviously bigger grille. A key strong point of the Hector has always been its cushiony drive quality. It still works well at keeping almost all effects from the undulations and uneven surfaces at bay from the occupants, especially on highway journeys. It\u2019s only over rough roads at slower speeds that you can experience some side-to-side movement and particularly sharp bumps inside the cabin.

    "question": "Confused between desil and petrol as the waiting period of desil is 2 year and petrol can be deliver withinyear",
    "answer": "Selecting the right fuel type depends on your utility and the average running of the car. If you drive less than 50km in a day then we recommend you to go with a petrol car as they are easy to maintain, have a longer life span and they cost less initially than the diesel car. On the other hand, diesel cars are preferred if the average daily run is more than 50km which makes it a feasible purchase. Diesel cars are more fuel-efficient and provide more torque, therefore, are preferred for a person who drives more than 50km. Whereas, petrol engine has a low service cost, more life span, generally have a well-controlled NVH level and are cheaper in cost than the diesel engines.

What you can do is is fold the third row to open up a nice and large flat boot floor which will accommodate all of your large suitcases and bags for the entire family for the weekend trip. If you still want more space then you can fold even the second row flat, which will open up space for oversized items like a washing machine or table.

  {
    "question": "Is it comfortable for driving in XUV700?",
    "answer": "The highlight of the petrol engine, while you might think is the 200PS power figure, is actually the refinement. It doesn't let any vibration or harsh sound creep into the cabin and gives you a very calm driving experience. Another highlight is its smooth power delivery because of which you get a very linear and smooth acceleration and the 200PS power figure does not feel intimidating. However, start getting generous with the throttle and the city overtakes are dispatched with ease. Even on the highway, all you have to do is press a little harder on the accelerator pedal and the XUV completes high speed overtakes just as easily. But even under full-throttle conditions, the performance of the petrol engine does not feel peppy or exciting. While the 200 horses are certainly there, they are focused on making your drive effortless rather than thrilling. Also as of now, there are no drive modes on offer with the petrol engines, and another thing that you will have to be careful of is the fuel efficiency. This being a 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine, hauling a large SUV will certainly not be as frugal as the diesel. The automatic transmission is also focused on making your drive as effortless as possible. It keeps you in the right gear and the shifts are quick and smooth. It's only when you demand a quick downshift that it can feel a tad slow. The diesel engine is also the one you should pick if you are mostly going to be on the highway. It gets four drive modes: Zip, Zap, Zoom and Custom. The one aspect of the XUV that you will absolutely love is the comfort it offers to its occupants. This time around the XUV gets frequency selective damping like the Compass, which will keep it stable in corners and over smaller bumps while softening the damping to take on bigger speed breakers and potholes. This really shows while you are driving on our mixed road conditions. The XUV can glide over the imperfections on the road and you won't feel much of the bigger undulations as well. The rear suspension does feel a tad soft but that too settles down quickly and does not make the right feel bouncy. And all of this happens with the suspension being absolutely silent. For a better understanding of compatibility and driving comfort, we would suggest you to take a test drive.

    "answer": "If you are looking for vehicles with discounts, the end of this year would be the best time to buy a BS4-era car. As manufacturers gear up towards getting their BS6 products on the road, they will be offering significant discounts on their BS4 counterparts to clear stock. They would try to do so well before the April 2020 deadline to avoid any unsold BS4 stock. So we expect most manufacturers to stop selling BS4 cars by early 2020. You could go bargain hunting then as the few unsold stocks could attract huge discounts. The reason to go for a BS6 vehicle despite the increased costs would be the added features. Also, you would be polluting the environment less. a transition from BS4 to BS6 has in most cases resulted in a minor drop in power. According to the upcoming emission norms, BS6-compliant four-wheelers should be 25 percent cleaner than their BS4 counterparts. While BS4 vehicles are currently allowed a NOx (Nitrous Oxide) pollutant level of 80mg/km, BS6-compliant vehicles will have NOx levels reduced to 60 mg/km."

    "question": "Which is good to buy, Honda Amaze or Maruti Baleno?",
    "answer": "Both the cars are good in their forte. The Honda Amaze scores well in most departments: - a punchy diesel motor, sedan-like comfort, and a well-loaded practical cabin. The weak link has to be its petrol engine, which is extremely refined and just about acceptable for city commutes but not for spirited driving. The 2021 Amaze continues to get a dual-tone layout for its interior which makes the cabin feel airier, spacious, and fresh. The build quality and fit-finish of the interior are impressive as well, and everything including the center console and equipment such as the front AC vents and glovebox is well-integrated. On the other hand, the new Baleno is based on the same Heartect platform as the old car and as a result, in terms of size it hasn't changed much. Wheelbase and width are exactly the same and in terms of length and height, it is slightly smaller. But what has gone up is weight. As compared to the old car the new Baleno is up to 65kg heavier. According to Maruti, 20 percent of the weight gain is because of the new Dual Jet motor and the rest of it is down to the thicker body panels. Whether that has lent any improvement in terms of safety is something that we will know only after it goes through a crash test. the Baleno is a value-for-money family hatchback that\u2019s practical, well-equipped, efficient, and easy to drive. Moreover, we would suggest you to take a test drive before making the final decision.

The only chink in its armour is looking to be the cabin width for three at the back, boot space and missing headline features. However, if MG can get the price right between Rs 10 lakh to Rs 18 lakh ex-showroom the Astor could well be among the favourites to pick in the segment. On the other hand, the Compass continues to excel at being itself. It remains a powerful yet easy SUV to drive that combines a cushioned ride experience with excellent corner stability to deliver an un-SUV like experience. Jeep\u2019s sweetened the pot with an all new interior which makes the experience more premium than before. It's also added many features that, to be honest, should have been there from before keeping the Compass\u2019 price in mind."

    "question": "How is the engine? Is it under-powered?",
    "answer": "We got our hands on the 1.3-litre turbo-petrol which makes 140PS of power and 220Nm of torque. It only comes mated to a 6-speed torque converter automatic. The other engine option available is 1.5-litre petrol which makes 110PS of power and 144Nm of torque. It can be had with a 5-speed MT and an optional 8-speed CVT automatic. The Astor\u2019s power delivery is smooth. This, right from the pickup, gives you a nice and linear acceleration. Start going on the throttle and the Astor builds speed in a strong manner. And because this is a torque converter automatic, the turbo lag is taken care of and you don't struggle for power while cruising in the city. Start going heavier on the throttle and the same linear acceleration greets you. It\u2019s not very exciting but there is ample pull for overtakes. And even beyond, the Astor keeps on going. At BIC, we recorded a 0-100kmph time of 10.76 seconds, which is impressive. And the Astor kept pulling ahead as well, with a recorded top speed of 164.33kmph. So be it city commuting or highway touring, the Astor, at least in its turbo guise, will manage it without breaking a sweat. Even the transmission, though a bit slow to shift on a racetrack, should feel fine in the city. Here, drive modes could have helped the Astor have a better dual personality. For a better understanding of compatibility and driving comfort, we would suggest you to take a test drive.

    "question": "Which is the best MG Hector or Kia Seltos?",
    "answer": "Both cars are good in their own forte, the Hector has always been a bold-looking SUV, thanks to the heavy chrome usage on its front fascia. The changes, though subtle, are a bit more \u2018in-your-face,\u2019 starting with the obviously bigger grille. It now features diamond-shaped chrome embellishments while the grille has a black surround instead of chrome, making it look a lot bolder. However, those who aren\u2019t a fan of extensive chrome on their cars would certainly feel it is too much here. A key strong point of the Hector has always been its cushiony drive quality. It still works well at keeping almost all effects from the undulations and uneven surfaces at bay from the occupants, especially on highway journeys. It\u2019s only over rough roads at slower speeds that you can experience some side-to-side movement and particularly sharp bumps inside the cabin. On the other hand, the Seltos continues to impress with added standard safety and claims better ride quality. It is a vehicle you can\u2019t go wrong with. Because of its high wow factor, it attracts a lot of attention. More importantly, it backs it up with a solid and sensible personality too. Moreover, we would suggest you to take a test drive before making the final decision.

    "question": "Which engine is best, 1.3 or 1.5?",
    "answer": "The first is 1.5-litre naturally aspirated (mated to a 5-speed manual and CVT automatic options), making 110PS. If you chase performance, you can go for the 1.3-litre turbo petrol (paired with a 6-speed torque converter) making 140PS. We drove the Astor mainly on the circuit, and after two hot laps around the Buddh\u2019s technical layout, we came away quite surprised. Obviously, it\u2019s not a sports car, but we weren't expecting it to be as much fun as it turned out to be. The turbo-petrol motor has good pulling power, and thanks to its free-revving nature, we managed to cross 160kmph down the long 1km straight with ease. The gearbox does feel a bit slow -- both in terms of upshifts and downshifts -- especially out on the racetrack. But on the road, it might prove to be quick enough. What this gearbox does well, however, is it masks this motor's initial lag, which is typical of most turbo-petrol engines. On the other hand, The 1.5-litre engine was the only choice and we managed to drive both the manual and auto variants. The engine is smooth and refined with linear power delivery and there's plenty of power for exciting twisty roads as well as effortless long trips. We had no trouble hitting triple-digit speeds with ease and Skoda's claims of 8.6 seconds to 100kmph sounds perfectly believable. Only going to drive in the city? Well, the motor pulls from as low as 1300rpm, so it has excellent driveability at city speeds as well.

It's comfortable over paved roads, absorbing small imperfections well, staying composed over bigger bumps, and settling quickly after. The suspension does a good job over completely broken roads as well and though there is some side-to-side motion, it isn't uncomfortable. This translates to good handling around corners as well. The Kushaq remains planted with very little body roll. The steering is comfortably weighted in the city and weighs up nicely on the highway as well.

Moreover, the SUV will rival the likes of the Kia Seltos, Maruti Suzuki S-Cross, Hyundai Creta, Renault Duster, Nissan Kicks, and the Volkswagen Taigun. On the other hand, the Vitara Brezza still remains a value for money offering with a smooth petrol engine, a spacious cabin, and very comfortable ride quality.

    "question": "I am looking for Skoda Superb. My priority is reliability, low maintenance and a decent mileage. Is it worth waiting for Fortuner or Kodiaq in 2021?",
    "answer": "The Superb is the last of a dying breed. All its competitors have suffered a painful death, being trampled upon by SUVs. The ones that managed to survive, like the Toyota Camry or the Honda Accord till some time ago, went hybrid. So the fact that the Superb still managed to come out the other end of the tunnel, using the formula of a luxurious, spacious and sporty limousine, which it first brought to India almost a decade ago is nothing short of an achievement itself. With this facelifted Superb, Skoda has once again reminded us of what we will miss once the SUVs and the electrics fully take over. A sedan that packs in luxury, comfort, space and sheer driving pleasure all in one. If only the Superb offered the very latest technology like the SUVs of today, maybe we would see a resurgence in its sales. It attracts a considerable service cost as per it premium. And after all this if you are still thinking about the Superb, our recommendation is, don\u2019t think twice. On the other hand, <a class='lnk-c' href='https://www.cardekho.com/overview/Toyota_Fortuner_2020/Toyota_Fortuner_2020.htm'>Fortuner</a> and <a class='lnk-c' href='https://www.cardekho.com/overview/Skoda_kodiaq_2020/Skoda_kodiaq_2020.htm'>Kodiaq</a> are of the different segment and have different characteristics too.

There are a lot of things that are working in its favor too. The interior quality is right up there with the best in the segment and in terms of features the Meridian is well specced out. The seating comfort in the front two rows is really good and being a Jeep, its off-road ability is commendable for a monocoque SUV.

On the other hand, Skoda\u2019s Kodiaq hasn\u2019t changed dramatically with the update. In our books, that\u2019s no bad thing. Sure, Skoda shouldn\u2019t have skipped out on ADAS tech. It continues to be a classy looker, has a sophisticated cabin, and is loaded with all the feel-good features you want at this price point.

    "answer": "As per requirement, we would suggest you go for Renault Kwid or S-Presso. Renault Kwid is a stronger car and spacious. It is funky and muscular looking and comes with a decent amount of features. On the other hand, The S-Presso, on the other hand, misses out on a lot of standard features such as LED DRLs, side cladding, and reversing camera. S-Presso also offers more cabin space. Maruti Suzuki has managed to eke out some serious space from a car this small. It\u2019s a genuine family car that can seat four six-footers with ease. The first part of the surprise is the cabin width. Despite being narrower by almost 60mm compared to the Kwid, the S-Presso manages to deliver better shoulder room.

    "question": "How's Renult KWID RXT? ",
    "answer": "The Kwid RXT comes with a BS6-compliant 0.8-litre (54PS/72Nm) petrol engine which is mated to a 5-speed manual. Renault claims a fuel efficiency of 22.7kmpl for this 0.8-liter engine. <a class='lnk-c' href='https://www.cardekho.com/overview/Renault_KWID/Renault_KWID_RXT.htm'>Renault KWID RXT</a> gets Power Steering, Power Windows-Front, Rear Parking Sensors, Keyless Entry, Voice Control, LED Headlights, Anti-Lock Braking System, Central Locking, Driver Airbag, EBD, Rear Camera, 8 inch Touch Screen with Android Auto,Apple CarPlay etc. If we talk about its exteriors, it gets Chrome inserts on the grille, dual-tone ORVMs in a different shade, dark metal coloured wheel covers and black B-pillar. The RXT variant is quite an enticing upgrade and those looking at the 0.8-litre engine will find it quite feature-loaded that too at a reasonable premium. But we would recommend only the 1.0-litre engine option with an optional package as it costs just around Rs 28,000 (Rs 8,000 extra for the passenger airbag) but brings more power and an extra airbag over the smaller engine version. The additional amount you spend will not affect your EMI amount by much either. If you are eyeing the Renault Kwid facelift, this is the one you should go for.

    "question": "KWID 1.0 RXT Opt AMT or Datsun Go T CVT, which is better option?",
    "answer": "Both cars are good enough and have their own forte. Though Datsun Go has a bigger engine, both the cars deliver similar power. But the pulling capacity of Datsun is better. Renault KWID comes with the option of AMT which allows you to drive the car in both modes(manual and Automatic). In an AMT gearbox, the gear shift takes place according to the sets of RPM and you might feel zerks while gear shifts on the other hand, Datsun Go comes with CVT where actually no gear shift takes place. The CVT relies on a pulley and belt system that allows it to provide infinite numbers of ratios. CVT also helps in improving a car\u2019s fuel mileage too. So, Datsun Go provides smooth and linear driving experience. Moreover, the KWID RXT Opt. has lots more to offer in terms of features and utility. However, the GO gets the benefit of active safety technology like electronic stability control, which makes it the safer choice and also it is spacious too.

    "question": "Should I buy the Renault Triber AMT current version or wait for the turbo engine launch next year",
    "answer": "Currently, there is no official information available regarding the launch of turbo engine. Moreover, you may go for the AMT version. Clearly, the Triber AMT has its shortcomings. But inside the city, they are very well camouflaged by the smoothness of the shifts, practicality of the cabin and the ride quality over bad roads. Plus, you also get a manual mode to take matters in for your own hand if you need quick acceleration. If you spend 90 percent of you kilometres driving inside the city, the Triber AMT, at a premium of Rs 40,000, will make for a hassle-free and competent companion. But if you spend more than that 10 percent time on the highways, then the Triber AMT\u2019s shortcomings like the slow shifts, stressed out engine and low efficiency will bother you more than its positives. Moreover, we would suggest you to take a test drive before making the final decision.

  {
    "question": "Is this car good for road trips and long distance drive on Highway?",
    "answer": "The engine\u2019s lack of punch is even more evident out on the highway. Make no mistake, the Triber AMT cruises well at around 90-100kmph which is great on an open three-lane highway. But driving on dual carriageways, the Triber AMT struggles a bit. When you want to execute a quick overtake, the gearbox takes its own sweet time to downshift. With more passengers on board, the lack of punch from this engine and gearbox becomes even more apparent and you have to plan every single move. Even the motor gets quite noisy above 2500rpm. When combined with the Triber\u2019s not-so-great sound insulation, the result is a car that doesn\u2019t feel effortless as far as highway driving is concerned. The Renault Triber\u2019s suspension does a great job of absorbing even the sharpest of bumps with ease, especially at low speeds. Even at high speeds, the ride is comfortable and despite being a light car, it has good straight-line stability.

  {
    "question": "How is suspension and jerks?",
    "answer": "The three-cylinder motor needs some motivation to get a move on. You will need to give initial throttle inputs to get it going, but when you do so, the drive gets pretty relaxed. The clutch feels light and gear action is also pretty smooth. Being a three-cylinder motor the vibrations are noticeable but not bothersome. They do get a little intrusive if you push it hard at around 4,000rpm. Overall, as a city driver the Triber does the job decently. The few times I\u2019ve taken it down the highway though, the motor has felt rather weedy. Anything above 80-90kmph felt like a bit of a struggle. If you put your foot down for a quick overtake, the gearbox is ridiculously slow to kick down too. And the moment you get the motor revving above 3,000rpm, the engine just starts screaming away. However, where the Triber really scores is its ride quality. The suspension setting is apt for our road conditions and can easily soak sharp bumps and potholes without breaking a sweat.

Except it, the scooped-up roof makes the cabin roomier for rear passengers and the 190mm of travel for the second row gives it the flexibility to fit passengers of all shapes and sizes. The middle row of the Triber is rather comfortable, especially when compared to its rivals. If the third row isn\u2019t in use, you can slide the middle row back and get loads of knee room. You can also recline the backrest by quite a bit, which in this price segment is unheard of. The bench itself is quite comfy with decent under-thigh support.

If you absolutely need the third row of seats, or even just the large boot, you will appreciate the versatility of the removable third row as well. It\u2019s packing in just enough features to get you excited, and there\u2019s reassurance in the safety department with four airbags as well. Yes, the Triber could do with a few more basic features we spoke about earlier, but other than that it hardly leaves you wanting. The engine feels adequate for handling city duties without breaking a sweat. But if you\u2019re someone who enjoys long road trips, you might feel the performance to be slightly underwhelming.If we talk about Altroz, While it does not manage to set a new standard in the segment, it will fit right into the mix with a long feature list, sharp looks and a comfortable ride. The engine refinement remains to be the major chink in the armour. So, if you want a feature-loaded car with better safety and premium looks, you may go for Tata Altroz. On the other hand, Elite i20 has the most refined engine among these three and offers smooth drive quality. Also it offers class-leading interior quality too. Do take a test drive before the final call.

    "question": "Should I wait BS VI Renault Triber?",
    "answer": "If you are looking for vehicles with discounts, the end of this year would be the best time to buy a BS4-era bike. As manufacturers gear up towards getting their BS6 products on the road, they will be offering significant discounts on their BS4 counterparts to clear stock. They would try to do so well before the April 2020 deadline to avoid any unsold BS4 stock. So we expect most manufacturers to stop selling BS4 bikes by early 2020. You could go bargain hunting then as the few unsold stocks could attract huge discounts. The reason to go for a BS6 vehicle despite the increased costs would be the added features. Also, you would be polluting the environment less. a transition from BS4 to BS6 has in most cases resulted in a minor drop in power. According to the upcoming emission norms, BS6-compliant two-wheelers should be 25 percent cleaner than their BS4 counterparts. While BS4 vehicles are currently allowed a NOx (Nitrous Oxide) pollutant level of 80mg/km, BS6-compliant vehicles will have NOx levels reduced to 60 mg/km."

    "question": "Which one is the best AMT or CVT",
    "answer": "Automated Manual Transmission is the automation of the conventional manual transmission system. There is no big change in terms of design, basic principles in AMT as compared to a manual transmission. AMT only eliminates driver\u2019s effort for the operation of clutch and gear shifting-selection as both are done automatically. In AMT, clutch and gear shifter-selector mechanism are operated by a hydraulically operated kit which is controlled by Transmission Control Unit. Shift shocks felt in manual transmissions are not eliminated in AMT. AMT provides a limited gear ratio i.e. 4/5/6 speed similar to a manual transmission. Whereas Continuous Variable Transmission, it replaces the gears with two variable-diameter pulleys, each shaped like a pair of opposing cones, with a metal belt or chain running between them. One pulley is connected to the engine and the other to the drive wheels. The halves of each pulley are movable; as the pulley halves come closer together the belt is forced to ride higher on the pulley, effectively making the pulley's diameter larger. In CVT engine is always operated at a favourable speed that gives best engine efficiency, whereas AMT engine is not continuously operated at a speed that gives out the best efficiency. Also in AMT, there is a drop in driving force during the gear shifting period that results in an unpleasant driving experience. For a CVT to be more fuel efficient than a manual, the driving must be very sedated and mostly constant speeds. For normal driving conditions, it may yield low fuel efficiency values. The CVT transmission is better because it has infinite gear ratio. Also, CVT is smoother than AMT."

    "question": "I am planning to buy a subcompact SUV soon (preferably Magnite or Kiger) and have a question about CVTtransmission. 1. Is it expensive to maintain vs Manual Transmission? Would it be 10% or 20% more expensive? 2.Would it be able to last 80-90k KM run or 9-10 years. I have heard CVT transmission repair or replacement isvery expensive and may cost 3-4 lacs. I am fairly a stable driver and would primarily use the car for officecity trips (in busy ties and high to medium traffic) and over weekends going to Mumbai or outdoor trips fromThane.(Total Running per year 5-7k KMs)",
    "answer": "Both cars are good enough and share a lot with each other. Though both cars are built on the same platform, both get different looks. The Nissan Magnite is a very tempting proposition and takes a different position vs its many rivals. Its pricing is applicable but along with that, this package does have some compromises too. For example, the cabin experience isn\u2019t rich and fitment quality is of a budget grade. While it does get a turbo petrol engine, it isn\u2019t complemented with a driving dynamics package that\u2019s particularly exciting. Of course, Nissan\u2019s sales and service network is also going into revival mode and its rivals have a clear upper hand here. Apart from it gets good safety too. If we talk about, Renault Kiger, it would be a great pick if you require more boot space and more storage in the interior of the car, also it offers 4 Airbags as compared to 2 Airbags of Nissan Magnate and a better sound system too.

However, for the exact service cost, we would suggest you to exchange your words with the <a class='lnk-c' href='https://www.cardekho.com/car-service-center.htm'>authorized service center</a>.

    "question": "How is drive on uneven roads?",
    "answer": "The Magnite\u2019s ride quality is a strong point. It deals with bad roads and potholes very well while keeping the occupants well insulated from surface imperfections. However, over some sharper bumps, the suspension noise is quite audible and you will hear the bumps more than you\u2019d feel them. On the handling front, the Magnite is decidedly aimed towards daily usability and not outright excitement. The steering is light and you can chuck it into corners but there is noticeable body roll. The suspension does feel soft while attacking curves and corners, the steering offers no feedback and you find yourself dialing in some corrective steer to get it on the line you want. Even braking is a slightly vague affair as the pedal offers enough bite but no feel i.e. you don\u2019t feel the pressure/resistance from the pedal change even as you press the pedal harder.

    "answer": "I took the Nissan magnite cvt xv premium o line for the base price of 9.84.The good features have been shared by a lot of ppl I'll add some of the features that I think the car is lacking but before I do,the best mileage I clocked on the car is 20.1 km even before the first service.1. Drive comfort is poor, owing to stiff suspension it neither helps on regular road or off road2. 3 cylinder engine has more vibration and can be felt in the cabin in terms of noise and vibration3. Arm rest is terrible on either side. I am 5'7 and I drive with the seat pulled back even then both arm rest are inadequate for resting your arms unless you tilt and sit to support atleast one arm and end up with a back pain. I'll customize this.5. The touch screen is pathetic as is with other cars. The wifi projections keep cutting in and out, screen goes blank at times, lag in performance. I will always advise getting a variant without screen n speaker and install a good tablet and speakers and can be done without loosing the warranty on the card if you know how to do it.6. The fuel tank on the right side has been a menace with you having to be positioned in the opp direction all the time at a fuel station.7. Ac is not good. My swift dezire from 2013, will cool the cabin under 3 min during peak summer drive while magnite takes 30 min. With price tag diff of over 4 lacks i expected better.8. The steering tilt function is a joke, the amount tilt is worthless and there is no steering column adjustability it isn't there in any of the suvs and thus you have to reach out for the steering n its tiring to drive.Between sonet and magnite i would have preferred sonnet if it wasn't for the safety rating"

I want to choose from Ford EcoSport, Kia Seltos, Hyndai Venue, and Nissan Magnite but look wise I like Magnite a lot but I'm too much confused regarding above concerns! Can anyone help here?",
    "answer": "The Magnite would be a good pick if you are eyeing for an SUV that\u2019s spacious, practical, well loaded and comfortable to drive, all delivered at a price tag that\u2019s serious value for money. Moreover, the aftersales service would depend on the availability of service centers in your city. As for the interior quality, it comes across as both a pleasant surprise as well as an indicator of where the cost factor comes into play. It\u2019s a very clean and clutter-free layout with no unnecessary styling elements added for the sake of making it look different. Even the finish quality of the plastics is smooth and the grey fabric on the door pads is a thoughtful touch. However, the plastics don\u2019t feel as robust or thick as they do in a Sonet, Venue, XUV300 or even EcoSport. We\u2019d say it\u2019s a step up compared to the Vitara Brezza but it\u2019s acceptable, not exceptional. Moreover, we would suggest you to take a test drive before making the final decision.

  {
    "question": "Which is better between Magnite and Sonet?",
    "answer": "There\u2019s very little to hold against Kia\u2019s Sonet. It could do with more cabin width to seat five better, and also add at least one more variant for the automatic transmission. An aspect where not just the Sonet but Kia themselves as a manufacturer needs to prove their long term reliability and dependability. The Sonet is ticking all the right boxes otherwise. It\u2019s delivering on the wow factor with pukka mini-SUV looks, quality interiors and a feature list that\u2019d make you question paying a premium for larger SUVs. It\u2019s being sensible and practical too, with loads of cubby holes and a large boot. You get proper automatics, and the engines on offer cover a wide range of usage. Kia\u2019s Sonet is rewiring our expectations from sub-4-metre SUVs. It\u2019s proving that a small vehicle can be big on experience. On the other hand, At its price, the Nissan Magnite is a very tempting proposition and takes a different position vs its many rivals. However, this package does have some compromises too. For example, the cabin experience isn\u2019t rich and fitment quality is of a budget grade. Many buyers do believe that SUV = diesel power and that isn\u2019t an option that you get here either. Also, while it does get a turbo petrol engine, it isn\u2019t complemented with a driving dynamics package that\u2019s particularly exciting. Of course, Nissan\u2019s sales and service network is also going into revival mode and its rivals have a clear upper hand here. Simply put, if you want the most premium and sophisticated pick from the segment, the Magnite probably isn\u2019t for you. But if you want an SUV that\u2019s spacious, practical, well loaded and comfortable to drive, all delivered at a price tag that\u2019s serious value for money, the Magnite is certainly worth considering. You may <a class='lnk-c' href='https://www.cardekho.com/compare/kia-sonet-and-nissan-magnite.htm'>compare</a> both cars accordingly. Do take a test drive in order to get better clarity.

    "question": "Is Magnite good for hilly region?",

While the former is mated to a 5-speed MT only, the latter can be had with either a 5-speed MT or CVT. It churns out 100PS and 160Nm (152Nm with the CVT gearbox).

    "question": "Which car will be better in ride , handling and comfort ? magnite turbo xv premium DT CVT or scoda rapid riderautomatic ?",
    "answer": "Both cars are of the different segments and have different characteristics. If we talk about Skoda New Rapid, there\u2019s no other way to say it but the Rapid\u2019s ride has always been a bit of a back-breaker. Owners and enthusiasts will be seen making excuses like \u2018it helps the handling\u2019 and what not. You\u2019ll now find that the Rapid handles smaller potholes or speed breakers with a little bit more dignity. However go over the sharper stuff a bit carelessly and you\u2019ll hear that dull but loud thud from the suspension. It might be dull in nature but it is enough to sink the heart of any self-respecting car owner. You will find that body roll is, like before, nonexistent. The steering, though, feels a little lighter at city speeds but is well weighted. And that will add to the convenience of making u-turns. But while you\u2019ll find the steering light to use in the city, it still feels quite stable at highway speeds. Less weight on the front allows this front-wheel drive sedan to corner more aggressively. This allows you to carry more speed through corners. The brakes feel reassuring and more than adequate for the Rapid\u2019s performance and size. You will miss feedback from the pedal though. On the other hand, the Magnite\u2019s ride quality is a strong point. It deals with bad roads and potholes very well while keeping the occupants well insulated from surface imperfections. However, over some sharper bumps, the suspension noise is quite audible and you will hear the bumps more than you\u2019d feel them. On the handling front, the Magnite is decidedly aimed towards daily usability and not outright excitement. The steering is light and you can chuck it into corners but there is noticeable body roll. The suspension does feel soft while attacking curves and corners, the steering offers no feedback and you find yourself dialing in some corrective steer to get it on the line you want. Even braking is a slightly vague affair as the pedal offers enough bite but no feel i.e. you don\u2019t feel the pressure/resistance from the pedal change even as you press the pedal harder.

    "question": "Should I choose Nissan magnite xl CVT over Tata tiago xz plus AMT ...My preference is safety and a solid,premium feel and comfort..",
    "answer": "Both cars are of different segments and selected variants have a big difference in their price tags too. If we talk about Tata Tiago, it has one of the most attractive designs at this price point. Great build quality and the 4-stars in Global NCAP speaks highly about safety. If you are on a budget and looking for a feature-loaded car and majorly drive in city only, you may go for Tiago. On the other hand, if we talk about Magnite, its strength lies in it covering the basics thoroughly. The looks are proportionate, and the feature list ticks all the essentials too. However, the bigger strength lies in its sensibility. It\u2019s among the few small SUVs that can genuinely seat five if needed. A comfortable suspension setup and a smooth CVT automatic strengthen its credentials as a family car. Though Magnite hasn't been tested by GNCAP yet, Magnite Turbo XL CVT gets a better safety feature list as compared to Tiago XZ Plus AMT. You may <a class='lnk-c' href='https://www.cardekho.com/compare/tata-tiago-and-nissan-magnite.htm'>compare</a> both cars accordingly. Do take a test drve in order to get better clarity.

    "question": "Hi,I was planning to buy tata altroz since it was meeting by budget of 9-10L . Do you think its worth toconsider buying magnite ?",
    "answer": "Both cars are good enough in their segments. The Tata Altroz fits right into the mix of the premium hatchbacks. But because it does not deliver a step-up or wow experience over its rivals, it fails to set a new standard in the segment. The lack of punch and refinement from the petrol limits it use to mostly in the city. Also, both the transmission and shift quality should have been better. But, what impressed us is the long feature list is the practicality of the cabin with loads of storage and a good fit and finish. The balance of the Alpha Apc platform too raises the bar on comfort and handling in the segment. On the other hand, at its price, the Nissan Magnite is a very tempting proposition and takes a different position vs its many rivals. If you want the most premium and sophisticated pick from the segment, the Magnite probably isn\u2019t for you. But if you want an SUV that\u2019s spacious, practical, well loaded and comfortable to drive, all delivered at a price tag that\u2019s serious value for money, the Magnite is certainly worth considering. You may <a class='lnk-c' href='https://www.cardekho.com/compare/tata-altroz-and-nissan-magnite.htm'>compare</a> both cars accordingly. Do take a test drive in order to get better clarity.

  {
    "question": "Is Nissan Magnite powerful ? Because it has only a 999cc engine?",
    "answer": "Magnite gets either the Renault Triber\u2019s 1.0-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine (72PS/96Nm) or a new 1.0-litre turbo-petrol unit. While the former is mated to a 5-speed MT only, the latter can be had with either a 5-speed MT or CVT. It churns out 100PS and 160Nm (152Nm with the CVT gearbox). The naturally aspirated engine variants would be a good pick if outright performance is not your priority and mostly drive in city only. If we talk about the Turbocharged engine variant, it is an easy-going city car and has enough grunt on offer to just commute, zip through traffic or make quick overtakes. There is some noticeable lag before the turbocharger kicks in around 1800rpm, but the motor feels usable even off boost for low-speed driving. The Magnate is also punchy enough to take the stress out of high speed overtakes, so long as you\u2019re in the right gear and keep the motor at around 2000rpm.

  {
    "question": "How's the build quality of Nissan Magnite?",
    "answer": "Nissan Magnite gets a pretty decent build quality. We can't give any verdict about its structural strength as it hasn't been tested by NCAP yet. If we talk about its interior, the finish quality of the plastics is smooth and the grey fabric on the door pads is a thoughtful touch. However, the plastics don\u2019t feel as robust or thick as they do in a Sonet, Venue, XUV300 or even EcoSport. Even the fitment quality is of a budget grade, with bits like the center console flexing/moving about when you fiddle with it. We\u2019d say it\u2019s a step up compared to the Vitara Brezza but it\u2019s acceptable, not exceptional."

If you are looking for a comfortable car with good safety and want better feature list at a price, you may go for Tata Tiago. On the other hand, Nissan Magnite has a lot of potential as a family car.

    "question": "Which one is the best Virtus or Slavia?",
    "answer": "Both cars are good in their own forte, Overall the Virtus is almost perfect but there are some things that could have been different or better. It has potent engines but its suspension setup is on the softer side, which gives it a comfortable ride but its handling is not that exciting. Its interior quality too won't wow you and cars like the Honda City are still a step above in this regard and because of the narrow cabin, it becomes strictly a four-seater. On the other hand, the Slavia has proved to be a very competent sedan. It looks good, drives and handles very well, is loaded with features and practicality, and the 1.0-litre engine is a great allrounder. If Skoda could have worked on improving the interior quality, the Slavia would have been an almost flawless package. But as it stands, the quality is a disappointment and the space for three at the back is limited. Moreover, we would suggest you to take a test drive before making the final decision.

    "question": "Is Taigun underpowered?",
    "answer": "On this drive we had the GT Line variants, which will exclusively come with the 1.5-litre turbocharged petrol engine with both manual and automatic transmission options. The other variants will get the 1.0-litre three cylinder petrol from the Polo and Vento, but in a higher state of tune.The 1.5 TSI is as refined as you\u2019d expect a Volkswagen engine to be. However the most impressive part of the engine is the way it delivers power. There is a good amount of torque at lower rpms to let you pick up effortlessly in traffic. And beyond 2000rpm, the turbo takes over and you are in GT territory. The acceleration is effortless and the power delivery is smooth all the way up to the redline. The engine doesn't sound all that good but the acceleration is what will keep you entertained. Shift close to the redline and you fall right back into the powerband to keep the momentum going. Speaking of gear changes, the manual shifts are slick however the clutch felt a bit springy and hard. The good part is that because there is good torque at low rpms, you don't have to shift often and city commutes can be tackled in 2nd or 3rd gears. You also have the option to override this logic with paddle shifters for more manual control. With this transmission, Volkswagen claims that the Taigun will reach 100kmph in 9.1 seconds, which is pretty quick.

It is spacious and comfortable, it is pretty well loaded and thanks to the option packs, even the lower variants can be customized to your requirements.

    "question": "Is BMW 2 Series better than the 3 series GT?",
    "answer": "With the 2 Gran Coupe, you\u2019d have to live with a rather average rear seat, and let go of a few premium features. Compact dimensions overall mean it will look small parked next to a compact SUV. So if you equate price to size, the baby Bimmer might seem a bit underwhelming. If you intend on hanging on to the car for long, it\u2019s worth considering flexing your wallet a little more, and eyeing the 3 Series. But if the youngster in you wants to dip his toes in the luxury market, only to update to a larger, midsize luxury car in the near future - when the kids grow up - the 2 Series Gran Coupe makes a solid case for itself. And it does so by not cutting any corners in offering you the \u201cluxury car\u201d experience. The looks will get people envious, the cabin quality is excellent, and the ride suits Indian roads (and tastes) too. To top it off the engine refinement and performance live up to BMW standards. It will feel like a properly expensive luxury car, especially to the first time lux-car buyer. The 3 GT on the other hand is a generation older and looks slightly dated compared to the 2 Gran Coupe. However, its new Shadow edition variant makes it a good value for money offering. You miss out on features like gesture control and an LCD instrument cluster but if those features are something you don\u2019t really require, the 3 GT makes a lot of sense. If you will be chauffeured around mostly and want a luxury car for the family, the 3 GT still makes a case for itself. You may <a class='lnk-c' href='https://www.cardekho.com/compare/bmw-3-series-gt-and-bmw-2-series.htm'>compare</a> both cars accoridngly. Do take a test drive in order to get better clarity.

  {
    "question": "Gurkha is good for daily use??",
    "answer": "The Gurkha is probably the most comfortable ladder-frame SUV on broken roads. The way it can flatten out broken patches and imperfections on the road at city speeds is mighty impressive. Occupants just glide over the roads and this comes with a sense of indestructibility as well. As a bonus, the suspension is quiet. This will be ideal for people who want to use it for commutes to their farms or project sites where roads do not exist. However, as the speeds start to climb, this floatiness of the Gurkha starts to become a disadvantage. The driver no longer feels connected to the tarmac and the cabin too moves around a lot. It\u2019s not jarring or harsh, but the movement itself can be scary. Handling too involves a lot of body roll and the steering barely offers feedback. All of this combined makes the Gurkha master of one trade - and that is to keep you comfortable where there are no roads. Road trips on highways will require a certain amount of trust in the driver. Moreover, we would suggest you to take a test drive before making the final decision.

If you drive less than 50km in a day then we recommend you to go with a petrol car as they are easy to maintain, have a longer life span and they cost less initially than the diesel car. On the other hand, diesel cars are preferred if the average daily run is more than 50km which makes it a feasible purchase. Diesel cars are more fuel-efficient and provide more torque, therefore, are preferred for a person who drives more than 50km. Whereas, petrol engine has a low service cost, more life span, generally have a well-controlled NVH level and are cheaper in cost than the diesel engines.
